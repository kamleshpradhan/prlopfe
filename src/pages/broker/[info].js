Michael pressured me to put offers on properties that weren't a good fit, and his communication was inconsistent. I ended up finding a house on my own.",

Jane's marketing strategies were top-notch, and she secured multiple offers above asking price. I wouldn't trust anyone else for a luxury sale.",

Ashley was very responsive and kept me updated throughout the entire process. However, I felt she could have provided a bit more guidance on the financial aspects of the deal.",
